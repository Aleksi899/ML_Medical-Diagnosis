# ML_Medical-Diagnosis
This Python project focuses on medical diagnosis using machine learning algorithms based on symptoms provided by patients. It utilizes various machine learning techniques to predict potential diseases based on symptoms.

Overview
The project consists of several stages:

Data Import and Preprocessing: Loads medical data containing symptoms and associated diseases. Preprocessing involves handling missing values and encoding categorical data.

Data Visualization: Utilizes visualization techniques to understand the relationships between diseases and symptoms. Includes bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.

Machine Learning Models: Employs various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest for disease prediction.

Code Breakdown
Data Import and Preprocessing
Imports necessary libraries (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Sklearn).
Reads the medical dataset and preprocesses it to handle missing values.
Data Visualization
Generates visualizations using Plotly Express, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Includes bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to understand disease-symptom relationships.
Machine Learning Models
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, and Random Forest classifiers.
Evaluates and reports the accuracy of each model.
Usage
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/IskanderRomdhane/ML_Medical-Diagnosis.git
cd medical-diagnosis
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Sklearn).
Install the dependencies:
pip install pandas plotly seaborn scikit-learn

Run the Code:

Execute the Python script containing the code segments.
The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, perform visualizations, and apply machine learning models.
